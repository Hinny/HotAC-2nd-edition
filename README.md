# Heroes of the Aturi Cluster Second Edition
Welcome to Heroes of the Aturi Cluster, 2nd Edition. This in an Unofficial Campaign Expansion to Star Wars X-wing Second Edition.

This is an attempt to convert the awesome Heroes of the Aturi Cluster cooperative campaign by Josh Derksen, to X-wing Second Edition.

There was care taken to leave the core experience and spirit of the original campaign intact, but a lot of small and large changes have been made throughout the campaign set to better suit X-wing second edition. This includes reducing any special cases used in this campaign to hopefully simplify gameplay and/or enrich the game experience. 

All components have gone through extensive redesign (with the exception of graphic design of obstacles, station modules and other play area features).

## Community and Forums
The hope is that the core campaign set and this GitHub repository can be solid foundations to a thriving mod community where there are a lot of large and small expansions, such as mission story arcs and enemy ship expansions as well as completely new campaign settings.

When all the content for the core campaign have been re-designed, the ambition is to create several easy-to-use resources for content-creators and modders to use. This is planned to be done mainly by creating resources for the X-wing 2nd Ed Strange Eons plug-in ([LINK](https://github.com/Hinny/strange-eons-xwing2)). But feel free to start designing your own expansion right away. A more comprehensive document about how to contribute to this project is planned but not yet available.
